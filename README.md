Welcome to the Hero Github Readme !

To all testers

Main Contributor flow :  we have done our best to make this test user friendly, but we are on the testnet, so you will need to bear in mind the following 
To contribute in Digital Currency you will need to have the Valora Alfajoles app on your phone, with at least 1 CEUR in faucets : if you need faucets, click here : https://celo.org/developers/faucet
To contribute in credit card, you will need to add a credit card in Transak, with any address and phone number in Europe or Canada and the following credit card number : 4111 1111 1111 1111, expiring 10/23, and CVV code 123

Mobilizers Flow (allowing Mobilizers to update their campaigns and to withdraw funds) : this can be accessed via the following link: https://hegemony.donftify.digital:3001/loginAct and logging in with  Phone Number: +22123456789, SMS code 000 and then using this password: HeroCoin112.
You can update campaigns and withdraw funds on a Valora Wallet.

For all developers : 
We have built on Celo, but to allow our reserves to generate yields, we have built a bridge with Compound protocol.
Our reserves will aim to hold 50% CUSD and CEUR, and 50% MOSS Carbon tokens, ie CMCO2.
We have encountered the following challenge on Alfajoles which is already documented on celo docs: we give the possibility of contributing to Hero in crypto, so contributors are then redirected to the Valora Alfajores app, they then validate the transaction in CUSD or CEUR in the Valora App, but even though the transaction is approved and indeed on the testnet blockchain, Valora closes but the connection between the Valora App and our webpage is interrupted, and instead of returning on the webpage where we were in the browser, it returns on the last webpage open in our browser. Whenthe userI then returns to our webpage in our app, we are stuck in the "transaction page" (ie the one where we were before) instead landing on the next web page in the flow.

Structure of the repository 
We have two branch : 
    -New-Branch our api created with node js
    -master branch our view

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
